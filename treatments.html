    <h4> Anxiety or Depression </h4>
    <p>Anxiety is your body's natural response to stress. It is a feeling of apprehension or fear of what's to come, and everyone will experience anxiety at some point in their life. Sadness is also a normal part of life and people will experience sadness in many different ways. But if you're feeling down or hopeless on a regular basis, you could be dealing with depression. </p>
    <p>But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme or if you feel that your daily life is being affected by depression, you might consider hypnotherapy as a treatment.</p>

    <h4> Fears and Phobias </h4>
    <p>Fear is there to protect us. It activates our bodies natural fight or flight instinct. However, if you develop an irrational fear reaction and phobia, this may interfere with the way you live your daily life. A phobia or fear is usually linked to something specific and the impact can vary.</p>
    <p>Public Speaking, dentists, flying, spiders – to name but a few. If you feel that a fear or phobia is stopping you from enjoying life to the full, maybe hypnotherapy is the answer for you.</p>

    <h4> Sleep/Relaxation/Inner Calm </h4>
    <p>Have trouble sleeping? Do you find it difficult to feel relaxed or to be at peace? It is normal to go through periods of the stress and chaos of our day to day lives can make it hard to switch off. Maybe it is interuppting your sleep and you find yourself waking up several times a night? Or perhaps you find it difficult to relax because of an over-active mind? Whatever the problem is, hypnotherapy can help with it. </p>
    <p>In our sessions I will work with you to identify the root of the problem and we can find a solution to a peaceful night's sleep.</p>

    <h4> Bereavement </h4>
    <p>The grief of losing someone you love can be an intense emotion to deal with. Although going through different stages of emotions is part of the natural grieving process, it can get to a point where the intensity affects our mental health. It can be difficult to move on but, when the time is right, celebrating a loved ones life through hypnotherapy can help assist the healing process.</p>
    <p>In hypnotherapy we will focus on recalling the loved one with clarity, say things which were left unsaid and focus on the positive memories. If you need help coming to terms with the loss of a loved one, get in touch to see what I can do for you.</p>

    <h4> Exam, Test and Interview Nerves </h4>
    <p>Everyone gets nervous as some point in their lives. When it comes to exams, tests and interviews we know that, logically, we are being tested on our knowledge and skills. But sometimes when you come to face it, you can be overwhelemed by a feeling of panic. If you feel like you are beind held back because of this, hynotherapy might be able to help you overcome the nerves.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you only need one session when it comes to dealing with nerves, but everyone is an individual. You just need to take the first step and I will help you along the way..</p>

    <h4> Habits </h4>
    <p>We all have habits, some good and some not so good. Habits are an action or pattern of behaviour that is repeated so often that it becomes typical, and sometimes you can be unaware of it. Other times, a habit can drive you mad. If you have a habit that you would prefer to not have, hypnotherapy might be the answer for you.</p>
    <p>In this case hypnotherapy can help you "un-learn" the repetitive habit by being consciously aware and changing your behaviour. Depending on the individual this could take one session or it could take three to four. </p>

    <h4> Confidence </h4>
    <p>The conscious mind, our inner thoughts, has the power to control how we feel about ourselves. Sometimes our conscious thoughts can be our biggest supporters and other times our harshest critics. It can be a challenge to overcome negative thoughts, which in turn affects our confidence. Hypnotherapy can be a powerful tool in identifying and targeting the root cause of low self esteem. </p>
    <p>During a hypnotherapy session, you’ll guide your body and mind to a state of heightened relaxation and awareness; which will help you speak directly to your inner thoughts. With the help of hypnotherapy we can address your confidence for the better.</p>

    <h4> Stress </h4>
    <p>Stress will affect everyone at some point during our lives. But the way that an individual will deal with their stress can vary quite a bit. For a variety of different reasons, stress could cause: weight gain too, depression and also anxiety.</p>
    <p>Perhaps there is a way I can help you get to the root of it all. With hypnotherapy we will encourage your body relax and guide it to a natural state. Once you are relaxed, we can discover more about the reasons behind your stress. </p>

    <h4> Weight Concerns </h4>
    <p>If you struggle with maintaining your ideal weight, perhaps the answer lies within the way you think about food. Maybe you feel that you are continiously making the wrong choices with the food that you eat. Perhaps you've started a diet but slipped off the wagon during a bad day. If this sounds like you, hypnotherapy can help you change your habits to make better choices for your health.</p>
    <p>For this treatment you can choose between a hypnotherapy session or a course of hypno gastric band. Contact me to find out the difference between the two and to see which one may suit you more.</p>
