    <p>Welcome to my downloads page. This is where you may find a recording for what you need.</p>
    <p> A hypnosis recording can be incredibly useful and successful, as long as you listen to the download on a repeated basis. Like many things in life, daily practice is one of the easiest ways to form a habit and/or achieve your goals, and hypnosis recordings work in the same way. The more you listen to an audio recording, the easier you will find it to recall when needed. </p>
    <p> Choose a time that is right for you and your lifestlye to listen to your recording. Some people find it best to listen before going to bed, others prefer listening at lunchtime and some prefer to listen upon waking up. Whichever time you choose, ensure you will be able to listen at the same time every day for at least 4 weeks.</p>
    <p> Research shows that it takes 4 weeks to practise a new habit and a former 4 weeks before it becomes part of your natural behaviour. If you find that you are still struggling after this time, it may be that you would benefit further from one on one sessions with a hypnotherapist.  </p>
